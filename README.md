# technovation-wp

Our Technovation Wordpress project set up as recommended in https://wpengine.com/git/ *without* core Wordpress files or 3rd party plugins.

To run the project locally, additional files will be needed through SFTP or retreiving a backup zip.

Deployment is not necessarily safe if necessary changes were made to these files outside of git.
